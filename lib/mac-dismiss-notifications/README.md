After reading the discussion from https://www.reddit.com/r/applescript/comments/jxhm19/clear_all_notifications_with_single_script_on_big/, I got the script from: https://gist.github.com/lancethomps/a5ac103f334b171f70ce2ff983220b4f 

 When I got this script BigSur has just come out and support for such automations is limited.
Probably a different versions of this script will appear later in future but for now, this works with BigSur.
